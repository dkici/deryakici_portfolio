          <h3>Turkish Airlines Online Orientation</h3>
          <p>This e-learning project was part of my three-month summer role as a contract Instructional Designer at Bilge Adam Corporation. It was developed for Turkish Airlines, the national flag carrier airline of Turkey, as an orientation program for both newly hired and existing employees. The primary objective of the course was to instill corporate identity, foster loyalty among current staff, and support new employees in making a smooth transition into the organizational culture.</p>
          <p><b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b> I joined the project in its final phase and was responsible for audio recording, sound editing, and integrating audio files into the training screens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Office 2007 Online Training</h3>
          <p>As a member of Bilge Adam’s e-learning team, I contributed to the design and development of interactive tutorials aimed at teaching the core Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook). Working closely with two highly experienced MS Office trainers as subject matter experts, I ensured that the tutorials were both accurate and pedagogically effective.</p>
          <p><b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b> My main responsibility was creating animations and simulations using Adobe Flash. I also worked extensively with Captivate, Photoshop, and other graphic tools to edit images, graphics, and multimedia files, ultimately producing engaging, learner-centered screen content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Aksa Online Work Security Training</h3>
          <p>This online training was developed for Aksa Akrilik Chemical Industry, a leader in its sector recognized for production quality, environmental practices, and social responsibility projects. Aksa supplies raw materials for textiles and technical textiles across many applications, from carpets to industrial fibers. The training included visuals (images, graphics, and animations) and audio components to introduce new employees and managers to the company’s culture, history, human resources, products, and work safety standards.</p>
          <p><b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b> I contributed to the design and development of the “Safety and Security at Work” module. My duties included defining creative and effective design concepts, structuring and sequencing content and objectives, designing interactive activities to achieve learning outcomes, defining media and technical strategies, preparing design documentation and scripts, and developing modules with tools such as Flash, Captivate, and Camtasia.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Teacher Pedagogical Knowledge Tutorials</h3>
          <p>This online training was created for teacher candidates preparing for the national Public Service Personnel Selection Examination (KPSS) in Turkey. Teacher candidates must pass the KPSS to begin a career in public schools, and this course was designed to provide them with structured, accessible preparation materials.</p>
          <p><b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b> I designed this course and developed detailed storyboards for three modules covering Teacher Pedagogical Knowledge. I prepared directions for Flash developers to build interactive components. The modules included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction to Educational Science (20 screens)</li>
            <li>Developmental Psychology (52 screens)</li>
            <li>Guidance (85 screens)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These modules featured a mix of images, graphics, text, audio, video, and interactive elements such as animations, simulations, and simple games.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Professional Image Online Training</h3>
          <p>This project was designed as part of my freelance work with Bilgi Kurdu E-learning Solutions. The training focused on the importance of professional image in the workplace, aiming to help both corporations and employees align personal presentation with organizational quality standards.</p>
          <p><b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b> I created storyboards and scripts, selected multimedia elements (images, graphics, and audio/video), and designed interactive screens that included animations, simulations, and simple games such as matching, drag-and-drop, and puzzles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Photosynthesis – Courseware Development (Grade 6/7 Biology)</h3>
          <p>I designed, developed, and implemented this interactive learning environment as my undergraduate graduation project. The project, aimed at teaching photosynthesis in the “Cycle of Matter and Energy” unit, was awarded <i>Best Educational Software</i> at the 2nd National Computer Education & Educational Technology Assembly at Bahçeşehir University.</p>
          <p>Photosynthesis is an abstract subject in Biology, often challenging due to limited laboratory opportunities. This courseware created an interactive microworld where students could explore the subject, receive immediate feedback, and study flexibly. The design integrated multimedia elements—graphics, sounds, animations, and simulations—to help students overcome misconceptions and connect abstract concepts to real-life phenomena.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>AKUT Online Volunteer Training</h3>
          <p>AKUT is a voluntary, non-governmental search and rescue organization in Turkey. In collaboration with Boğaziçi University, a group of senior Educational Technology students, under the coordination of Prof. Yavuz Akpınar, developed an online volunteer training program consisting of 11 modules.</p>
          <p><b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b> Together with a collaborator, I developed Modules 8 and 9. These interactive modules were designed around real-life stories to enable learners to connect training content with real-world applications. This approach allowed learners to engage in meaningful scenarios, strengthening both knowledge and practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who is the Thief? – Goal-Based Scenario (GBS) Design</h3>
          <p>This project, completed as part of my Master’s thesis (2011–2012), involved designing, developing, and implementing an interactive learning environment using Schank’s Goal-Based Scenario (GBS) design model. The learning objectives were to improve adult learners’ problem-solving skills and to foster collaborative learning.</p>
          <p>The GBS design included mission context (mission and cover story) and mission structure (plans, strategies, and learner actions). Learners engaged in authentic, story-driven tasks such as managing a simulated shoe factory, considering competitors and customers, and sustaining production efficiency. This design approach emphasized problem-solving through experiential, collaborative scenarios.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Bebek Oyunu TV</h3>
          <p>“Bebek Oyunu TV” is an online portal for children (ages 0–6) and their parents. Its dual purpose was to provide parents with pedagogical resources about child development and to create engaging, interactive environments for children. Parents could also share experiences and participate in discussions on specific topics.</p>
          <p><b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b> I developed seven interactive games and three animations using Adobe Flash and ActionScript 2.0, helping young learners engage with content while supporting parents in their educational roles.</p>
